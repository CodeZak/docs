## Language and Terminology

Customize your directory's language and field names to match your specific niche. This is especially helpful when your directory isn't focused on traditional businesses.

### Why Customize Terminology?

Different directory types need different terminology:

| Directory Type | Default Term | Custom Term |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Real Estate | "Business Information" | "Property Details" |
| Properties | "Listing" | "Property" |
| Restaurants | "Operating Hours" | "Service Times" |
| Services | "Business Name" | "Service Provider" |
| Events | "Location" | "Venue" |

### Customizable Fields

You can update the following labels to match your niche:
