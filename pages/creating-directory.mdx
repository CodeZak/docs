# Getting Started

After you sign in, head to : Directoryeasy.com/client/directories/new

Create a Standard or Business directory in three steps: choose language, choose type, fill the form, and submit.

Important: Only these fields are required to create a new directory:

* Name
* Tagline
* Subdomain
* Categories (at least one category with at least one subcategory)

#### Step 1: Choose a language

* Pick the language for directory (We support +22 Languages).

#### Step 2: Choose a directory type

* Standard directory: Product/service–oriented. Enables product-focused listing fields by default (logo, pricing, demo link, coupons).
* Business directory: Business/location–oriented. Enables business-focused fields by default (operating hours, business phone, map/location).

You can still customize fields later in the Fields tab.

#### Step 3: Complete the form (tabs overview)

The form is organized into tabs so you can configure everything cleanly. Remember, you can return and edit any setting after creation.

**General**

* Name (required): Public directory name.
* Tagline (required): Short descriptive line shown in hero/marketing areas.
* Subheading: Optional longer introductory text.
* Buttons: Add Listing and Newsletter button texts.
* Hero Button (text + link): Optional call-to-action in your hero section.
* Images: Logo, Favicon, Hero image.
* Active Status: Toggle directory visibility.

**SEO**

* SEO Title, Description, Keywords: Defaults for your directory home page.
* SEO Image: The social/OG image used when your directory is shared.

**Social**

* Add your social profiles (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, GitHub, TikTok, Pinterest, Snapchat, Reddit, Medium, Telegram, Discord). These may display in the footer/header depending on your theme.

**Domain**

* Subdomain (required): your-directory.directoryeasy.net. Can be disabled later if you only want a custom domain.
* Custom Domains: Add after the directory is created (DNS and SSL verification required). You can set primary domain, redirects between domains, and WWW preference.

Notes:

* Custom domains can only be added after creation.
* DNS changes may take time to propagate; SSL provisioning typically takes 5–15 minutes after verification.

**Fields**

Decide which listing fields are enabled and required for your directory. This directly controls:

* What submitters must provide in the listing form
* What's validated during CSV import (required fields must be mapped)

Tips:

* Name and Categories are always required.
* You can add Custom Fields (e.g., color, size) from the Customization → Custom Fields area (Sidebare); each custom field can be marked required or optional. When active, they appear as `custom_<fieldName>` in CSV template/import.

Type defaults (you can change any of these later):

* Standard: Enables product-focused fields like logo, lowestPrice, pricingModel, demoLink, coupons. Disables business-only fields (operating\_hours, business\_phone, location\_map) by default.
* Business: Enables business-focused fields like operating\_hours, business\_phone, location\_map. Disables product-only fields (logo, pricing, demo, coupons) by default.

**Categories**

* Build your categories and subcategories with drag-and-drop.
* Requirements to create a directory:
  * At least one category
  * Each category must have at least one subcategory

Matching mode:

* Union (OR): Show listings that match any selected category.
* Intersection (AND): Show listings that match all selected categories.

**Pages**

* Create custom pages (e.g., About, Hiring). Content is edited in a rich markdown editor. Draft or publish pages.
* Depending on your plan, there may be limits to the number of custom pages.

**Navigation**

* Manage header navigation links. Link types:
  * Default: Built-in routes
  * Custom: Any URL
  * Custom page: Select one of your Custom Pages

**Footer**

* Configure footer sections (links), copyright, tagline, and which parts to show (contact info, categories, recent listings, social links).

**Languages**

* Enable internationalization, set default locale, and add available locales.

#### Tips and troubleshooting

* Can't submit? Check the Categories tab first—make sure you created a category and added a subcategory.
* Plan to use a custom domain? Create the directory first, then add your domain and complete DNS + SSL.
* Not sure which type to pick? Choose the one closest to your use case; you can still customize fields later.
