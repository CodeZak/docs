## Tips and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't submit the form?" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Solution**: Check the Categories tab first. Make sure you've:
    - Created at least one category
    - Added at least one subcategory to that category
    
    This is the most common reason forms don't submit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Want to use a custom domain?" icon="globe">
    **Solution**: 
    1. Create the directory with a subdomain first
    2. After creation, go to domain settings
    3. Add your custom domain
    4. Complete DNS verification
    5. Wait for SSL provisioning (5-15 minutes)
    
    Custom domains cannot be added during initial creation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not sure which type to pick?" icon="question">
    **Solution**: Choose the directory type closest to your use case. Remember:
    - Standard = Products/Services/Digital
    - Business = Physical locations/Local businesses
    
    You can customize all fields later, so this isn't a permanent decision!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Need to change settings later?" icon="gear">
    **Solution**: All settings can be edited after creation! Navigate to your directory's settings panel and modify any tab you need.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Subdomain already taken?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Solution**: Subdomains must be unique across all DirectoryEasy users. Try:
    - Adding numbers (tech-tools-2024)
    - Adding your niche (saas-tools-directory)
    - Using hyphens differently (tech-tools-hub)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
