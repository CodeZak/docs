If a user wants to add a listing to favorites, leave a review, or claim their business, they need to create their own account in your directory.

## Getting Started

To begin, users need to:

1. Head to the sign-up page
2. Enter their name, email, and password
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Confirm their email
5. Sign in

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides quick access to all key metrics in your directory:

* **Number of listings** you've added
* **Favorites** count
* **Reviews** you've given or received
* **Active plans** (if you have any subscriptions)

When someone subscribes to one of your plans, they get access to a special dashboard where they can manage their plan.

The dashboard also shows:

* Recent listings
* Reviews you've given or received
* Recently added favorites
* Your latest subscription

You can add new listings, manage existing ones, and access reviews or billing settings using the dashboard buttons or directly from the sidebar.

## Adding a New Listing

The "Add New Listing" section allows you to manually create a new listing. There are other ways to add listings in bulk from client (directory owner) dashbaord:

* Importing a CSV file
* Linking your Google Sheet with the platform

### Website Auto-Extraction (Optional)

If the listing is linked to a website, users can add their website URL so that the system automatically extracts the title and description. Simply:

1. Enter the website URL
2. Click "Continue with Website"
3. Wait a few seconds for the title and description to be generated automatically

### Listing Form Tabs

The listing form is organized into customizable tabs. You can choose which ones to show or hide, and even add new custom fields for your directory. These tabs include:

#### Business Tab

* Business phone
* Operating hours
* Location

#### Media Tab

* Upload up to three images
* Add one YouTube video

#### Categories and Tags

* Select relevant categories
* Add tags

#### Links and Description

* Main listing link
* Demo link (if available)
* Detailed description

You can write the description manually or generate it using AI. Click "Generate" and wait a few seconds for the AI to create the content. As a directory owner, you can customize the AI prompt used to generate this content from your client dashboard, controlling its length and tone.

#### Pricing Section

Users can determine the pricing model for their listing:

* **Free**: No cost
* **Paid**: Enter the price, choose the currency, and indicate whether it's the lowest price
* **Contact for pricing**: Requires contact to get pricing

**Lowest Price Feature**: This is useful for services with multiple plans. Since users can't submit all plans, they can only show the lowest price and mark it as such. A plus sign will then appear next to the price to indicate that the service starts at that amount.

You can also add a coupon code if available.

#### Social & SEO Section

* Add social links
* Manage SEO settings using the SEO Manager tool

The SEO Manager works similarly to Yoast on WordPress, helping users optimize their listings for better visibility.

## Listings Management

In the Listings section, users can view all the listings they've added along with their status:

* **Featured**: Indicates whether a listing is highlighted
* **Status**: Can be Pending, Approved, Published, or Rejected

### Listing Status Explained

When you first submit a listing, it stays in the **Pending** state, unless it's added by the directory owner. After review, the owner can approve, publish, or reject it.

**What's the difference between Approved and Published?**

* **Approved**: The directory owner has reviewed the listing but hasn't published it yet. It can either be published immediately or scheduled for automatic publishing after a certain number of days. This is often used for free plans, where users must wait before their listings go live.
* **Published**: The listing is live and visible on the directory.

To publish instantly, users can upgrade to a paid plan — and that's one of the main ways to monetize your directory.

## Favorites

In the Favorites section, members can view all their saved listings.

## Reviews

The Reviews section allows members to see both:

* Reviews they've given
* Reviews they've received

## Claim Listings

Claiming a listing allows users to verify business ownership and prevent others from claiming it.

You'll see a message: "Verify that you own these businesses to prevent others from claiming them."

### Verification Methods

You can use the search bar to find the business you want to claim. Once you select it, you'll see different verification methods:

#### Email Domain Verification

Ownership is confirmed by matching your listing's domain with your account email. For example, if your listing domain is `mycompany.com`, your account email should also be from `@mycompany.com`. Personal emails like Gmail or Yahoo won't work unless the listing itself uses those domains.

#### Business Email Verification

Your account email must match the business email shown in the listing. Once verified, the listing is automatically claimed under your account, giving you full control to manage and update it.

#### Website Code Verification

1. Generate a unique verification code
2. Add it to your website's HTML, either in the head or body section
3. Click "Verify Ownership"
4. The system will confirm it automatically

Verified listings will then appear under "My Verified Listings."

## Settings

### Details Tab

* Manage your profile name and avatar
* Upload a new avatar or delete the current one
* Update your display name, which appears publicly on the directory

### Email Section

### Security Section

* Update your password by entering your current and new passwords

Users can manage active subscriptions and billing details. All subscribed plans appear here with their status and renewal options. If there are no active subscriptions, a message will say: "You are not subscribed to any listing plans."

### Notification Settings

Users can manage email preferences for:

* Marketing updates
* Product news
* Security alerts

Click "Update" to save your preferences.

### Account Deletion

At the bottom, in the Account section, users can permanently delete their accounts if they wish.
