    **Reviewed and accepted**, but not yet public
    
    - Directory owner has approved the content
    - Scheduled for publishing (automatic or manual)
    - Often used with publishing delays for free plans
    
    **Use case**: Free tier listings that must wait 30-60 days before going live

### Approved vs Published

<Card title="Key Difference" icon="circle-question">
**What's the difference between Approved and Published?**

**Approved** listings have been reviewed and accepted by the directory owner but aren't published yet. They can either be:
- Published immediately by the owner
- Scheduled for automatic publishing after a set number of days

This is often used for **free plans**, where users must wait (e.g., 30-60 days) before their listings go live.

**Published** listings are live and visible to everyone on the directory immediately.

**Monetization opportunity**: To publish instantly, users can upgrade to a paid plan — this is one of the main ways to monetize your directory!
