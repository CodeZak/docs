## Member Reviews

Enable community engagement while maintaining quality through moderated reviews.

### How the Review System Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Member Submits Review">
    Members submit reviews through listing detail pages with ratings and comments.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Pending Status">
    Every review is automatically set to **Pending** status until approved.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Email Notification">
    Directory owners receive instant email notifications for new reviews.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Owner Approval">
    Review the submission and approve or reject it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Public Visibility">
    Approved reviews become publicly visible immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Critical**: Ensure your SMTP email settings are properly configured to receive review notifications. Without proper email setup, you won't know when reviews are submitted!
</Warning>
