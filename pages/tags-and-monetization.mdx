DirectoryEasy provides powerful tools for organizing your listings with tags and generating revenue through subscription plans. This guide covers everything from creating flexible tag systems to setting up payment processing and building tiered pricing models.

## Understanding Tags

Tags are flexible labels you can assign to listings for enhanced organization and filtering. Unlike categories or custom fields, tags provide a more informal way to group listings by special attributes, features, or editorial designations.

### When to Use Tags

Use tags for:

* Special features (e.g., "Outdoor Seating", "WiFi Available")
* Awards and recognition (e.g., "Award Winner 2024")
* Editorial picks (e.g., "Hidden Gem", "Local Favorite", "Staff Pick")
* Atmosphere descriptors (e.g., "Romantic Atmosphere", "Family Friendly")
* Dietary options (e.g., "Vegetarian Friendly", "Gluten-Free Options")

Tags differ from categories and custom fields in their flexibility—they're ideal for attributes that don't fit into your structured data model.

## Managing Tags

The Tags page displays all your existing tags along with usage statistics.

### View Existing Tags

Each tag entry shows:

* **Tag name**: The label visible to users (e.g., "Breakfast", "Group Dining", "Modern", "Traditional")
* **Usage count**: The number of listings currently assigned to this tag

### Tag Actions

For each tag, you have three management options:

* **Edit tag**: Rename the tag to better reflect its purpose
* **Delete tag**: Remove the tag entirely from your directory
* **Manage**: Assign or remove this tag from specific listings

## Creating New Tags

To add a new tag to your directory:

1. Navigate to the Tags page in your dashboard.
2. Click **Add New Tag**.
3. Enter the **Tag Name** in the form.
4. Click **Add Tag** to create it, or **Cancel** to close without saving.

### Tag Naming Examples

For different directory types, consider these tag naming patterns:

**Restaurants:**
* "Vegetarian Friendly"
* "Romantic Atmosphere"
* "Family Friendly"
* "Live Music"
* "Waterfront Dining"

**Services:**
* "Emergency Available"
* "Free Consultation"
* "Licensed & Insured"

**Retail:**
* "Local Artisan"
* "Eco-Friendly"
* "Custom Orders"

## Using Tags for Filtering

Once created and assigned to listings, tags become powerful filtering tools:

1. Assign tags to relevant listings through the Manage option.
2. Users see available tags in the directory filters.
3. Visitors can filter listings by selecting one or multiple tags.
4. This helps users quickly find listings with specific attributes they're looking for.

## Monetization Overview

DirectoryEasy provides comprehensive monetization tools, allowing you to generate revenue from your directory through subscription plans, featured placements, and premium services.

## Payment Settings

Before you can accept payments, you need to connect at least one payment processor. DirectoryEasy supports two major payment providers.

### Available Payment Processors

**Stripe Connect**
* Seamless credit card processing
* Modern checkout experience
* Automatic payment handling
* Lower transaction fees
* Excellent for recurring subscriptions

**PayPal Express**
* Familiar payment option for many users
* Trusted brand recognition
* Alternative for users without credit cards
* Quick setup process

### Connecting Payment Processors

1. Go to **Payment Settings** in your dashboard.
2. If no payment methods are connected yet, you'll see both Stripe Connect and PayPal Express options.
3. Click **Connect** on one or both processors depending on your needs.
4. Follow the authentication process for each provider.
5. Once connected, your directory can accept payments immediately.

> **Tip**: You can connect both Stripe and PayPal to give users payment flexibility. Funds go directly to your connected accounts.

After connecting payment processors, you can create subscription plans and offer premium features.

## Subscription Plans

Subscription plans let you create paid tiers with different features and pricing models, enabling you to monetize your directory effectively.

### Enable Subscriptions

Before creating plans:

1. Navigate to **Subscription Plans** in your dashboard.
2. Toggle **Enable Subscription Plans** to activate subscription functionality.
3. Without this enabled, all plans remain inactive regardless of configuration.

## Creating a New Plan

To build a subscription tier:

### 1. Plan Name

Give your plan a clear, descriptive name that helps users understand the tier level:

* Basic
* Premium
* Professional
* Enterprise
* Starter

Choose names that clearly differentiate between your tiers.

### 2. Plan Type

Select one of two payment models:

* **One-time payment**: Users pay once and receive lifetime access
* **Recurring subscription**: Ongoing billing at regular intervals (monthly, yearly, etc.)

Choose based on your business model and what makes sense for your directory.

### 3. Description

Write a short, compelling summary explaining what this plan includes:

* Main features and benefits
* Any limitations or restrictions
* What makes this tier unique
* Who this plan is best suited for

Keep it concise but informative to help users make informed decisions.

### 4. Pricing and Currency

Set the price point for your plan and select the appropriate currency:

**Supported Currencies:**
* USD (US Dollar)
* EUR (Euro)
* GBP (British Pound)
* CAD (Canadian Dollar)
* AUD (Australian Dollar)
* JPY (Japanese Yen)
* And many more

Pick the currency that fits your target market. If you need a currency that's not listed, contact support to have it added.

### 5. Featured Plan (Optional)

Toggle **Featured Plan** to highlight this tier as:

* Most popular choice
* Recommended option
* Best value

Featured plans stand out visually, helping guide users toward your preferred tier.

### 6. Plan Features

List all features included in this subscription tier. Common features include:

* **Featured placement**: Number of days the listing appears as featured
* **Ad spots**: Premium advertising positions
* **Priority support**: Faster response times

Be specific about what each plan offers so users understand the value.

### 7. Save Your Plan

* Click **Add Plan** to create a new subscription tier
* Click **Save Changes** if editing an existing plan

## Plan Presentation

After creating your subscription plans:

1. They automatically appear as options when users submit new listings.
2. Users can choose their preferred tier during the submission process.
3. The system handles payment processing and feature activation automatically.
4. You can edit, disable, or delete plans at any time from the dashboard.

## Monetization Strategy Tips

Consider these approaches when building your pricing structure:

**Tiered Approach:**
* Free or Basic: Limited features to attract users
* Premium: Enhanced features for serious users
* Professional: Full feature access for power users

**Value-Based Pricing:**
* Price based on the value delivered (e.g., featured placement duration)
* Higher tiers offer significantly more visibility or features

**Freemium Model:**
* Offer a free tier with basic functionality
* Charge for premium features like featured placement, as spots or priority support

**Feature Bundling:**
* Combine complementary features in higher tiers
* Create clear differentiation between plans
