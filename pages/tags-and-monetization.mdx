    **Impact**: Tag is removed from all listings permanently
  </Tab>

## Using Tags for Filtering

Tags become powerful filtering tools once assigned to listings.

### How Tag Filtering Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Tags">
    Add tags that represent filterable attributes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign to Listings">
    Use the Manage option to add tags to relevant listings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Filter Display">
    Tags automatically appear in the directory filter sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User Filtering">
    Visitors select one or multiple tags to filter results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refined Results">
    Directory shows only listings matching selected tags.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="Multi-Tag Filtering" icon="layer-group">
Users can select multiple tags to narrow their search:

**Example**: User selects "Vegetarian Friendly" + "Outdoor Seating" + "Live Music"
**Result**: Only listings with all three tags are shown

This helps visitors quickly find exactly what they're looking for!
</Card>

Tags complement your category system and custom fields to create a powerful, multi-dimensional search and filter experience.
