## Overview

Automation is where DirectoryEasy really shines. It lets you set up workflows that automatically manage your listings - from publishing delays to featured placement - all based on subscription plans.

## How Automation Works

When someone submits a new listing, it's automatically assigned to the **Starter** plan. Here's something important to understand:

<Warning>
Automation rules only kick in for listings with an **Approved** status. If a listing is sitting in Under Review, you'll need to approve it first before any automation happens.
</Warning>

Once you've approved a listing, you have two paths:
- **Manual control**: Manage everything manually for complete control
- **Automatic processing**: Let the system take over and automatically publish listings based on configured rules

### Processing Schedule

The system runs checks **every hour** to update listing statuses. However, if you don't want to wait, you'll see **"Process"** buttons that let you trigger immediate processing. This is handy when you've just approved a batch of listings and want them processed right away.

<Info>
Both the Publishing Delay and Featured Listing rules work together during processing, and they're applied based on each listing's subscription plan.
</Info>

## Setting Up Publishing Delays

The Publishing Delay feature is useful when you want a waiting period before listings go live.

### Common Use Case

The typical workflow is:
- Don't publish free listings until a certain period passes (e.g., one or two months)
- Submit immediately if users upgrade their listings to a paid plan

### Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to the automation settings for each plan (e.g., "Starter")
2. Toggle the **Enable** switch on
3. Set the number of days you want listings to wait
4. Click **Save Changes**

<Tip>
For example, if you set 30 days for the Starter plan, approved listings will sit for 30 days before automatically going live.
</Tip>

### Immediate Processing

If you need to push things through faster, click **"Process Delayed Listings Now"** and the system will immediately publish any listings that are ready.

## Configuring Featured Listings

Featured Listing rules control how long listings get premium placement in your directory. Featured listings appear at the top of search results, in slider sections, or both.

### Setup Process

1. For each plan, toggle the rule on
2. Set the number of days for featured placement
3. Save your changes

<Card title="Monetization Example" icon="dollar-sign">
Let's say you set 7 days for a Premium plan - when those listings publish, they'll automatically be featured for a full week before returning to normal status. You can inform users that after they upgrade their plan, their listings will be featured for 7 days.
</Card>

### Immediate Processing

The **"Process Featured Listings Now"** button works the same way as with publishing delays. Click it when you want to update featured statuses immediately instead of waiting for the hourly check.

## Practical Example

Here's how it all flows together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listing Submission">
    A restaurant owner submits their listing. It starts on the Starter plan and goes into **Under Review** status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approval">
    You approve the listing, changing its status to **Approved**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publishing Delay (if configured)">
    If you've set a 2-day publishing delay for Starter, it waits 2 days then automatically publishes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Featured Period (if configured)">
    If you've also enabled a 5-day featured period for Starter, it stays featured for 5 days after publishing, then drops back to a regular listing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Premium Plan Example

Imagine you have a Premium plan with:
- **No publishing delay** (0 days)
- **30-day featured period**

Those listings publish immediately and stay featured for a month. That's the power of combining subscription plans with automation.

## Getting Started

Remember to click **"Save Changes"** after you've configured your rules for each subscription plan.

### Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic rules for your Starter plan, then customize for premium tiers
- **Test thoroughly**: Use the "Process Now" buttons to test your automation rules immediately
- **Monitor regularly**: Check the hourly processing results to ensure automation is working as expected
- **Communicate clearly**: Make sure your users understand the benefits of upgrading (immediate publishing, longer featured periods, etc.)
