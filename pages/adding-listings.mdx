## Overview

DirectoryEasy provides flexible control over who can submit listings, how they're reviewed, and what information is collected. With custom fields, you can tailor the submission process to match your directory's unique requirements.

<Info>
Three types of users can submit listings: **directory owners**, **registered members**, and **visitors**. You control who has access and what they can do.
</Info>

## Submission Permissions

Configure who can submit listings to your directory based on your business model and goals.

### Accessing Submission Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Dashboard Sidebar">
    Navigate to your DirectoryEasy dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go to Customization">
    Click **Customization → Misc → Listings**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Use the **"Who can submit listings"** setting to choose your preferred mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Permission Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Owner Only">
    **Maximum control** - Only you can add listings
    
    **What happens**:
    - Public submission button is hidden
    - Sign-up page becomes inaccessible
    - You curate all content manually
    
    **Best for**:
    - Highly curated directories
    - Quality-first approach
    - Directories in early stages
    - Industry-specific professional listings
    
    **Example**: A curated directory of award-winning architects where you personally vet and add each entry.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Owner + Members">
    **Gated submissions** - Registration required
    
    **What happens**:
    - Users must sign in or create account before submitting
    - Public submission button redirects to sign-up page
    - All submissions enter review queue
    
    **Best for**:
    - Building a user database
    - Reducing spam
    - Accountability and follow-up
    - Community-driven directories
    
    **Example**: A directory where you want to know who submits what, with ability to contact submitters about their listings.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Anyone">
    **Open submissions** - No registration required
    
    **What happens**:
    - Guests can submit without accounts
    - Submissions still enter review queue (nothing auto-publishes)
    - Lower barrier to entry
    
    **Best for**:
    - Rapid growth
    - Maximizing submissions
    - Less friction for contributors
    - Crowdsourced directories
    
    **Example**: A comprehensive directory where volume matters and you want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Visibility Settings

<Card title="Listing Visibility Control" icon="eye">
Beyond submission permissions, you can also control:

- **Public visibility without account**: Submissions visible to everyone immediately (after approval)
- **Account required to view**: Users must create accounts to view full listings beyond a preview limit

This creates a **freemium model** where registration unlocks full directory access.
</Card>

<Tip>
**Important**: Even when guests can submit, every listing enters the review queue first—nothing publishes without your approval!
</Tip>

## Visitor Submission Flow

When public submissions are enabled, the submission process is straightforward and user-friendly.

### Submission Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Submit Button">
    Visitors click the "Submit your listing" button (label is fully customizable).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Form">
    Fill in all enabled fields:
    - **Required fields** (listing name is always required)
    - Optional details like pricing, coupons, custom fields
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Listing">
    Click "Submit listing" button to send for review.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enters Pending State">
    The new listing automatically enters **Pending** status awaiting your review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Built-In Fields Control

Customize which default fields appear in your listing submission form.

### Accessing Field Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Edit Directory">
    From your dashboard, click "Edit Directory".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Fields Tab">
    Navigate to the **Fields** tab in the directory editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Field Groups">
    See all built-in fields organized by category/tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Field Configuration Options

For each built-in field, you can:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enable/Disable" icon="toggle-on">
    Turn fields on or off completely
    
    **Disabled fields**:
    - Don't appear in submission form
    - Won't be collected from users
    - Hidden from listing pages
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Optional/Required" icon="asterisk">
    Set whether field must be filled
    
    **Required fields**:
    - Must be completed to submit
    - Validated before submission
    - Ensure you get critical data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Built-In Fields

| Field | Typical Use | Directory Type |

| **Logo** | Brand identity | Standard (products/SaaS) |
| **Operating Hours** | Business schedules | Business (local/physical) |
| **Business Phone** | Contact number | Business directories |
| **Location Map** | Physical address | Local directories |

<Tip>
Tailor the form to match the data your directory needs while keeping the experience streamlined for submitters. Less is often more!
</Tip>

## Review and Publish Submissions

Manage incoming submissions through your owner dashboard.

### Finding Submissions

Navigate to the listings table in your dashboard where new submissions appear with status **Pending**.

### Reviewing Actions

For each submission, you have three options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Reject">
    **Decline the submission**
    
    **Process**:
    1. Review the listing content
    2. Decide it doesn't meet criteria
    3. Click "Reject"
    4. Optionally send submitter a message explaining why
    
    **Best for**: Low-quality submissions, spam, off-topic listings, policy violations
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Approve">
    **Accept but don't publish yet**
    
    **Process**:
    1. Review and accept the content
    2. Mark as "Approved" status
    3. Listing remains hidden from public
    4. Can be scheduled for later publishing
    
    **Best for**: Free tier listings with publishing delays, batching approvals
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Publish">
    **Make it live immediately**
    
    **Process**:
    1. Review and accept the content
    2. Click "Publish"
    3. Listing goes live instantly
    4. Optionally email submitter with edit link
    
    **Best for**: Premium listings, immediate publication, owner-added listings
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Approved vs. Published

<Card title="Understanding the Difference" icon="circle-question">
**Approved** means you've reviewed and accepted the content, but it's not visible yet. You can:
- Schedule automatic publishing after a set delay (e.g., 60 days for free plans)
- Publish manually when ready
- Use automation rules (see Automation guide)

**Published** listings are visible to the public immediately and appear in all search results and filters.
</Card>

<Warning>
When you publish a listing, you can send the submitter an email with a temporary edit link. If they make changes, the listing returns to **Pending** status for you to re-review.
</Warning>

## Using Custom Fields

Once created, custom fields integrate seamlessly into your listing workflow.

### Member Submission Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="See Custom Sections">
    Custom sections and fields appear organized in the submission form exactly as configured.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Information">
    Users fill in custom fields (e.g., cuisine type, price range, outdoor seating).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Listing">
    Custom field data is included with the submission.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Appears in Filters">
    After approval, filterable fields appear in directory sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Displays on Listing">
    Field values show on listing detail pages as configured.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CSV Import with Custom Fields

Custom fields work with CSV imports:

<Card title="CSV Column Format" icon="file-csv">
Custom fields appear in CSV templates and imports as: `custom_<fieldName>`

**Examples**:
- Field name: `cuisine_type` → CSV column: `custom_cuisine_type`
- Field name: `square_footage` → CSV column: `custom_square_footage`

When importing, these columns are automatically mapped to your custom fields.
</Card>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="minimize">
    Begin with essential fields only. Add more as you understand your users' needs.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Clear Labels" icon="text">
    Make field labels immediately understandable. Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Group Related Fields" icon="object-group">
    Organize fields into logical sections to keep forms manageable.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Limit Required Fields" icon="asterisk">
    Only require fields that are absolutely essential. More requirements = fewer submissions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test the Form" icon="vial">
    Submit test listings yourself to ensure the form flow makes sense.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Optimize Filters" icon="filter">
    Only make fields filterable if they have limited options. Text fields don't filter well.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom field not appearing in form" icon="eye-slash">
    **Check**:
    - Field is marked as "Active"
    - Section is marked as "Active"
    - Field is properly assigned to a section
    - Directory settings allow the field
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Field not showing in filters" icon="filter-circle-xmark">
    **Solution**:
    - Enable "Show in Filters" for the field
    - Enable "Show in Filters" for the section
    - Ensure field type is suitable for filtering (select, checkbox, number)
    - Free text fields don't work well as filters
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CSV import not recognizing custom field" icon="file-excel">
    **Solution**:
    - Use correct column name format: `custom_<fieldName>`
    - Ensure field name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
    - Export a sample listing to see correct format
    - Create the custom field before importing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many submissions (spam)" icon="ban">
    **Solutions**:
    - Switch to "Owner + Members" mode to require registration
    - Use manual approval for all submissions
    - Consider adding reCAPTCHA if available
    - Review and reject spam quickly to discourage spammers
