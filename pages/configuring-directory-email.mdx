After creating a new directory, the next step is to configure your directory email settings. This setup is essential to ensure that your directory members receive automatic email notifications whenever their listing status changes.

For example, if you reject a listing, the member will automatically receive an email with the rejection reason and a link to edit and resubmit their listing. Similarly, you will also receive a notification email whenever a new listing is submitted and requires your review.

## How to Configure Your Directory Email

In your dashboard sidebar, go to **Emails** and click **Configuration**.

You'll need to connect your professional email address through an SMTP service.

You can use Zoho Mail, which offers free professional email accounts, or any other SMTP provider you prefer.

If you need help setting up Zoho Mail, check the video linked below for a quick tutorial.

Once your email is ready, fill in the fields as follows:

* **SMTP Host**: `smtp.zoho.com`
* **SMTP Port**: `465`
* **Secure Connection**: Checked
* **SMTP Username**: Your email address
* **SMTP Password**: Your email password (securely encrypted in our database)

Click **Save** to complete the setup.

Your directory will now send emails using your own professional address, ensuring that both you and your members receive timely and branded notifications.
