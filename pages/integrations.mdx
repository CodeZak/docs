### How Webhooks Work

<Card title="Event Notifications" icon="bell-on">
When an event occurs, DirectoryEasy sends a POST request to your endpoint with:

**JSON Payload**: Contains event details and data

**Request Signature**: Each request includes a signature (`X-DirectoryEasy-Signature`) to verify authenticity

You can use this signature to confirm the request came from DirectoryEasy.
</Card>

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify the Signature" icon="shield-check">
    Verify the signature of incoming requests using your webhook secret.
    
    This ensures the request is legitimate and from DirectoryEasy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement Idempotency" icon="copy">
    Implement idempotency to handle duplicates.
    
    Process each webhook event only once, even if received multiple times.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Respond Quickly" icon="bolt">
    Respond quickly (within 5 seconds).
    
    Return a 200 OK response as soon as possible to acknowledge receipt.
  </Accordion>
