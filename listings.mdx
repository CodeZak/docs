* **Add New Listing**: Create a listing manually with a form.
* **Columns**: Show/hide table columns to customize your view.
* **Delete Selected**: Remove the listings you've checked. You can also choose to delete associated images.
* **Delete All**: Appears when all rows on the current page are selected; removes all currently listed items.
* **Update Selected (admins)**: Bulk-update Status/Featured/Subscription Plan for checked listings.

#### Table row actions (three dots on each row)

* **Change Status (admins)**: Approve, Publish, Reject, or set Pending for that listing.
* **Edit**: Open an editor to update the listing details.
* **Delete**: Remove the listing (with optional image deletion).

#### Editing a listing

* Opens an editor with sections for basic info, contact, media, categories/tags, location, social links, pricing, coupons, and optional SEO fields.
* Save to apply changes; the list refreshes automatically.

#### Update Status (admins)

* **Status options**: Pending, Approved, Published, Rejected.
* **Email notifications**: If your directory's email settings are active, you can send an email to the submitter:
  * **Rejected**: Provide rejection reasons (required if sending email).
  * **Approved/Published**: Optionally note modifications made.

#### Feature settings

* **Featured**: Mark a listing as featured to highlight it.
* **Expiration date**: Set when the featured status should end.
* **Exempt from automation**: Keep this listing out of any automatic featuring/unfeaturing rules.

#### Subscription Plan

* Choose a plan for the listing from your available directory plans (e.g., Free, Starter, Pro).
* Saves and reflects on the listing card/visibility rules where applicable.

#### CSV import

* **Choose file**: Upload a .csv file.
* **Map columns**: Match each CSV column to a system field. Required fields must be mapped before you can continue.
* **Allow duplicates**: Turn on if you want to import listings that have the same name as existing ones. Otherwise, duplicates are skipped.
* **Progress**: Imports in batches with a live progress bar and estimated time.
* **Results**: See how many were imported, skipped (duplicates), or failed, with per-row error details.
* Notes:
  * Special characters (e.g., accents) are handled automatically.
  * Large imports might take a while; don't close the dialog until complete.

#### CSV export

Downloads all listings with the fields available in your directory, including basic info, categorization, pricing, links, coupons, contact, location, social, status/flags, SEO (if enabled), and any active custom fields.

#### CSV template

* A single-row starter file with the right headers for your directory.
* Use it to see exactly which columns are expected and how to format values (e.g., categories/tags as comma-separated lists).

#### Required fields

* **What's required**: At minimum, Name and Categories are required. Your directory may require more fields (including custom ones).
* **Who sets this**: The directory owner configures which fields are enabled and required in the Edit Directory → Fields tab. Also, When adding a custom field (in Custom Fields), you can choose whether it's required or optional.
* **During import**: You must map all required fields; otherwise the import button stays disabled. The template and mapping panel will indicate what's required.

#### Tips and troubleshooting

* **Missing required fields**: Map all required columns in the import dialog before continuing.
* **Categories/tags**: Use comma-separated names; unknown names are handled gracefully (new tags may be created).
* **Duplicates**: Disable "Allow duplicates" to skip rows with names that already exist.
* **Encoding**: If you see odd characters in your CSV, re-export as UTF‑8; the importer also tries to auto-fix common encodings.
